🌌 A World Away: AI-Powered Exoplanet Discovery Platform

Overview
A World Away is an AI-powered platform built to accelerate the search for new worlds beyond our solar system. Using data from NASA’s Exoplanet Archive and Kepler/TESS light curves, this system automates one of astronomy’s most time-consuming processes — identifying exoplanet candidates hidden in vast streams of stellar brightness data.

The project combines the precision of data science with the curiosity of space exploration, allowing researchers, students, and enthusiasts to detect exoplanet signals using artificial intelligence — all in a matter of seconds.

🚀 How It Works

The platform processes raw stellar light curve data, which represents the brightness of stars observed over time. Small dips in brightness may indicate that a planet is passing in front of its host star — a phenomenon known as a transit.

Our AI pipeline performs several key tasks:

Preprocessing – Cleans and normalizes raw flux data, removing instrumental noise and gaps.

Feature Extraction – Identifies unique patterns in brightness variations.

Classification Model – A deep learning model built with TensorFlow distinguishes between true exoplanet transits and false positives caused by noise, cosmic rays, or binary stars.

Visualization Dashboard – Displays light curves, detected transits, and confidence scores in an interactive format for easy interpretation.

🧠 Core Technologies

Python – For data processing and integration.

TensorFlow – For training and deploying the classification model.

Pandas & NumPy – For efficient data handling and transformations.

Matplotlib & Seaborn – For generating intuitive visualizations of detection results.

NASA Exoplanet Archive Datasets – For real-world astronomical data and validation.
